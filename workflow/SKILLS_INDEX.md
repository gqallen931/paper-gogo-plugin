## 工作流技能（`workflow/skills/`）

### nature-skills（9 个）

| 技能 | 说明 |
|---|---|
| `nature-academic-search` | Multi-source literature search, citation verification, MeSH search strategy, citation file management (.nbib/.ris/.bib conversion), and reference management (BibTeX, related articles, ID conversion) via MCP tools (PubMed, CrossRef, arXiv). Use when the user needs coordinated multi-step literature workflows beyond a single MCP call. |
| `nature-citation` | Add strict Nature/CNS citations to manuscript text by splitting long passages into citable segments, searching only accepted flagship and subjournal titles from Nature Portfolio, the AAAS Science family, and Cell Press, filtering by publication time range, and exporting one reference-manager-ready output by default. Use this skill whenever the user asks to input text and automatically get references, add citations to a paragraph/manuscript, find Nature-series or CNS support for statements, create text-to-reference correspondence, "分段引用", "自动给出引用", "Nature系列引用", "CNS及子刊", "支撑文献", "补引用", "找引用", or export EndNote/RIS/ENW/Zotero RDF. |
| `nature-data` | Prepare, audit, or revise Nature-ready Data Availability statements, data repository plans, dataset citations, and FAIR metadata checklists for manuscripts. Use when the user asks about Nature data availability, research data sharing, repository selection, accession numbers, restricted or sensitive data, source data, supplementary datasets, DataCite-style dataset references, FAIR metadata for academic publication, or Chinese-to-English data availability wording for Chinese-speaking authors preparing Nature-family submissions. |
| `nature-figure` | Submission-grade Nature/high-impact journal figure workflow for Python or R. Use whenever the user asks to create, revise, audit, or polish manuscript figures, multi-panel scientific plots, figures4papers-style matplotlib plots, or journal-ready SVG/PDF/TIFF outputs, especially for Nature-family or other high-impact journals. Before plotting, define the figure's conclusion, evidence logic, export needs, and review risks. If the user has not chosen Python or R, ask "Python or R?" and stop. Use only the selected backend for figure generation, previewing, exporting, and QA. Supports matplotlib/seaborn and ggplot2/patchwork/ComplexHeatmap. Not for dashboards or Illustrator/Figma-first infographics. |
| `nature-paper2ppt` | Build a complete but efficient Nature-style Chinese PPTX presentation from a scientific paper, preprint, PDF, article text, abstract, figure legends, or reading notes. Use this skill whenever the user asks to make slides/PPT/PPTX for journal club, group meeting, paper sharing, thesis seminar, lab meeting, department report, or academic presentation from a research paper, not only medical papers. It identifies the paper type and argument, selects only the figures needed for the story, writes Chinese slide content and speaker notes, creates the actual .pptx deck, and performs lightweight verification with cross-platform Python tooling by default. |
| `nature-polishing` | Polish, restructure, or translate academic prose into Nature-leaning English using writing-strategy principles, curated Nature/Nature Communications article patterns, and phrase-level support from Academic Phrasebank. Use whenever the user asks to polish a manuscript paragraph, abstract, introduction, results, discussion, conclusion, title, methods section, or Chinese academic draft for publication-quality English. |
| `nature-reader` | Build full-paper Chinese-English side-by-side, figure/table-aware, source-grounded Markdown readers for journal or conference papers from PDF, DOI, arXiv, publisher HTML, or pasted text. Use whenever the user asks to translate or read a paper, make 中英文对照/原文对照/全文翻译解读, extract figures or tables into the right positions, preserve figure/table placement near relevant prose, or keep exact source anchors for every block. This skill must not degrade into a summary-only output unless the user explicitly asks for a summary. |
| `nature-response` | Draft, audit, or revise point-by-point reviewer response letters for Nature-family manuscript revisions. Use when the user provides reviewer comments, editor decision letters, revision notes, response drafts, or asks how to respond to major/minor revision requests, rebuttal letters, response to reviewers, peer-review reports, 审稿意见回复, 逐点回复, 修回信, 大修回复, 小修回复, or 如何回复 reviewer. |
| `nature-writing` | Draft, restructure, or plan Nature-style manuscript sections from author-provided claims, results, figures, notes, or Chinese drafts. Use when the user wants to write or rebuild an abstract, introduction, results narrative, discussion, conclusion, title, or full manuscript argument rather than only polish finished prose. |

### code-understanding（9 个）

| `understand-onboard` | （未声明 description） |

### architecture-engineering（8 个）

| 技能 | 说明 |
|---|---|
| `codebase-design` | Shared vocabulary for designing deep modules. Use when the user wants to design or improve a module's interface, find deepening opportunities, decide where a seam goes, make code more testable or AI-navigable, or when another skill needs the deep-module vocabulary. |
| `domain-modeling` | Build and sharpen a project's domain model. Use when the user wants to pin down domain terminology or a ubiquitous language, record an architectural decision, or when another skill needs to maintain the domain model. |
| `grill-me` | A relentless interview to sharpen a plan or design. |
| `grill-with-docs` | A relentless interview to sharpen a plan or design, which also creates docs (ADR's and glossary) as we go. |
| `grilling` | Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design. Use when the user wants to stress-test a plan before building, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrases. |
| `improve-codebase-architecture` | Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick. |
| `resolving-merge-conflicts` | Use when you need to resolve an in-progress git merge/rebase conflict. |

### world-model-method（1 个）

| 技能 | 说明 |
|---|---|
| `world-model-method` | A general-purpose working mode that makes the assistant produce output the "world-model way" — define an explicit goal and cost, build an abstract model of the situation, predict the consequences of several candidate approaches, search/optimize for the best full plan, and only then render the concrete output — instead of generating it token-by-token off the top. This operationalizes Yann LeCun's objective-driven / world-model / planning ideas (JEPA, "A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence") as a reusable prompt-level method for ANY non-trivial task: important writing, decisions, strategy, problem-solving, system design, planning. Trigger when the user says "用世界模型工作法 / 按 LeCun 那套来做 / 别顺嘴生成，给我规划出来的 / 想清楚再答 / objective-driven / plan it, don't just write it", or when a task is complex enough that deliberation and comparing alternatives clearly beats a first-draft answer. |

### paper-framework-figure-studio-pro（1 个）

| 技能 | 说明 |
|---|---|
| `paper-framework-figure-studio-pro` | Design, generate, critique, select, jointly audit, and finalize publication-ready computer-science research-paper framework figures through a stateful S0-PAPER-FOUNDATION to S7-FINAL-JOINT-AUDIT workflow.

| 技能 | 说明 |
|---|---|
| `karpathy-guidelines` | Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring code to avoid overcomplication, make surgical changes, surface assumptions, and define verifiable success criteria. |

### python-expert（1 个）

| 技能 | 说明 |
|---|---|
| `python-expert` | This skill should be used when the user asks to implement, debug, profile, or optimize Python code for scientific computing, data pipelines, ML models, training loops, evaluation, or reproducible experiments in Paper-gogo Phases 4, 6, 7, or 8. |
